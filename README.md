# Todo-Angular

The Angular CLI ToDo application is a simple web application that allows users to manage their to-do lists. The application is built using Angular Materials and Bootstrap.

With this application, users can easily add, edit, and delete their to-do items. The to-do items can be dragged and dropped from one column to another, making it easy to track their progress. The application is divided into three columns: active to-do, in progress, and finished to-do, giving users a clear picture of their tasks' status.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
